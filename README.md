A Basic to Verilog Compiler 

This is a first cut at a BASIC to Verilog compiler.

All files are (C) 2017, Richard P. Martin, and under the GNU General Public License, version 3,
unless otherwise noted in the source code.

The compiler is still quite rough and may have bus. You will need iverilog version 10 to
run the examples. The compiler should generate synthesizable code. 

To compile, go to the examples directory and run make.
